const handleLogoUpload = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const file = event.target.files?.[0];
  if (file) {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = (e) => {
      const result = e.target?.result as string;
      setLogoPreview(result);
      setLogoFile(file);
      const newOptions = {
        ...qrCodeOptionsState,
        image: result
      };
      setQrCodeOptions(newOptions);
      onOptionsChange(newOptions);
